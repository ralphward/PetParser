# PetParser

This is a small project written in .Net Core 2.0. It consumes some JSON data from a PetSupplier API

PetParser takes the data, loads it into a model, converts it for redsiplay into a ViewModel and displays it on a razor front end.

PetParser Includes examples of IoC, Logging, Error Handling, Dependency Injection and xUnit testing framework.

This is obviously over engineered for what it does, it's really just to display some modern programming skills and knowledge
